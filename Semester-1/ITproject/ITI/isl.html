    <p>For the video explanation of epilepsy</p>

    <p>Epilepsy, also known as seizure disorder, is a neurological disorder that causes recurrent seizure episodes, and it has various types. In some cases, its cause can be identified, while in others, the cause remains unknown.</p>

    <p>Epilepsy is a common disorder. Estimates from the Epilepsy Foundation indicate that one in every 26 people will be affected by this disorder. Epilepsy affects individuals of various genders, races, ethnic backgrounds, and ages.</p>

    <p>Symptoms of seizures can vary widely. Some individuals may lose consciousness during a seizure, while others do not. Some people may stare into space for several seconds during a seizure, while others may experience repetitive jerking movements in their arms and legs, known as convulsions or contractions.</p>

    <p>Experiencing one seizure does not necessarily mean having epilepsy. The diagnosis of epilepsy is made if you have had two unprovoked seizures separated by at least 24 hours without an apparent cause. Unprovoked seizures are those without a clear cause.</p>

    <p>Medication or, in some cases, surgery can control seizures for most individuals with epilepsy. Some people may require lifelong treatment, while in others, seizures may eventually disappear. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition as they age.</p>

    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Symptoms of epilepsy vary depending on the type of seizure. Since epilepsy results from specific brain activity, these seizures can affect any process happening inside the brain. Symptoms of seizures include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Temporary confusion</li>
        <li>Staring into space</li>
        <li>Muscle stiffness</li>
        <li>Uncontrollable arm and leg movements</li>
        <li>Loss of consciousness or awareness</li>
        <li>Mental symptoms, such as fear, anxiety, or déjà vu</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sometimes, individuals with epilepsy may experience behavioral changes. They may also exhibit symptoms of psychosis.</p>

    <p>In most cases, a person with epilepsy experiences the same type of seizure each time, and therefore, the symptoms of the seizure usually remain consistent.</p>

    <h3>Warning Signs of Seizures</h3>
    <p>Some individuals with focal seizures may experience warning signs moments before the onset of a seizure. These warning signs are known as auras and may include feelings such as stomach sensations or fear. Some people may experience déjà vu. Auras can involve sensations like taste or smell. They might also be visual, such as a fixed or flashing light, color, or shape. Some individuals may feel dizzy and lose balance, while others may see things that are not present, known as hallucinations.</p>

    <p>Epileptic seizures are classified as either focal seizures or generalized seizures, based on the nature and location of the brain activity causing the seizure.</p>

    <h4>Focal Seizures</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Focal Aware Seizures (Simple Partial Seizures):</strong> These seizures do not cause loss of consciousness. They may result in changes in emotions or alterations in the perception of things, such as their shape, smell, touch, taste, or sound. Some individuals may experience a feeling of déjà vu or involuntary spasms in parts of the body, such as the arm or leg, along with spontaneous sensory symptoms like tingling, dizziness, seeing flashing lights, or hearing noises.</li>
        <li><strong>Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures (Complex Partial Seizures):</strong> These seizures are accompanied by a change in consciousness or awareness. Individuals may appear to be staring into space, not responding normally to their surroundings. Movements like rubbing hands, chewing, swallowing, or walking in circles may occur.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: #df8C38;">Causes of Epilepsy</h2>
    <p>No specific cause is found for epilepsy in half of those affected by this condition. In the other half, various factors may contribute, including:</p>

    <h3>Genetic Influence:</h3>
    <p>Some types of epilepsy run in families, suggesting a genetic influence. Certain genes have been linked to specific types of epilepsy, but some individuals experience non-genetic epilepsy. Genetic changes can make a person more susceptible to environmental conditions that trigger seizures.</p>

    <h3>Head Injury:</h3>
    <p>Epilepsy can result from a head injury caused by accidents or other physical trauma.</p>

    <h3>Brain Factors:</h3>
    <p>Brain tumors and abnormalities in blood vessel formation can lead to epilepsy. Strokes are a common cause of epilepsy in adults over 35 years old.</p>

    <h3>Infections:</h3>
    <p>Infections like meningitis, HIV, viral brain infections, and certain parasitic infections can trigger epilepsy.</p>

    <h3>Pre-birth Injuries:</h3>
    <p>Infants born before term are more susceptible to brain damage, which can result from factors such as infections in the mother, malnutrition, or oxygen deficiency, leading to epilepsy or cerebral palsy.</p>

    <h3>Developmental Disorders:</h3>
    <p>Epilepsy can occur with developmental disorders. Individuals with autism are more prone to epilepsy, and research suggests common genetic factors in both epilepsy and developmental disorders like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>

    <h2>Complications</h2>
    <p>Seizures can lead to serious situations for you or others:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Falling: During seizures, falling may result in head injuries or bone fractures.</li>
        <li>Drowning: Individuals with epilepsy are more prone to drowning, around 13 to 19 times higher, due to the possibility of a seizure occurring in water.</li>
        <li>Car accidents: Seizures causing loss of consciousness or control can be dangerous when driving or operating machinery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many states impose restrictions on a driver's ability to control seizures when issuing a driver's license. These states set a minimum time that should pass without seizures, ranging from several months to a few years, before allowing driving.</p>
    <p>Sleep problems and complications during pregnancy are also common. If you are pregnant and have epilepsy, seek medical help when planning for pregnancy.</p>
    <p>Memory problems may occur, and individuals with epilepsy are more susceptible to psychological issues such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.</p>
    <p>Less common but possible life-threatening complications include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Status epilepticus: A prolonged seizure lasting more than five minutes, associated with a higher risk of permanent brain damage and death.</li>
        <li>Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP): Individuals with epilepsy have a slight risk of unexpected sudden death. The cause is not well understood but may be related to heart or respiratory issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Individuals with frequent tonic-clonic seizures or those whose seizures are not well controlled by medication may have a higher risk of SUDEP.</p>

<section>
    <h2 style="color: #df8C38;">Risk Factors</h2>
    <p>There are certain factors that may increase the likelihood of developing epilepsy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Age: Onset of epilepsy is more common in children and older adults; however, it can occur at any age.</li>
        <li>Family history: If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of experiencing seizures.</li>
        <li>Head injuries: Head injuries can lead to some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce this risk by wearing a seatbelt while driving, using a helmet during activities such as biking, skiing, motorcycling, or engaging in other activities with a risk of head injury.</li>
        <li>Stroke and other vascular diseases: Stroke and other vascular diseases can cause brain damage, potentially triggering epilepsy and seizures. You can take steps to reduce your risk by limiting alcohol intake, avoiding cigarette smoking, following a healthy diet, and engaging in regular exercise.</li>
        <li>Dementia: Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults.</li>
        <li>Brain infections: Infections like meningitis, causing inflammation in the brain or spinal cord, can increase the likelihood of epilepsy.</li>
        <li>Childhood seizures: The occurrence of seizures is sometimes linked to severe fever in childhood. However, children who experience seizures due to high fever generally do not develop epilepsy. The likelihood of a child developing epilepsy increases if they have a long seizure accompanied by high fever, have another neurological disorder, or have a family history of epilepsy.</li>
    </ul>
