              <h2>
   what are the sympotoms and causes of heart disease?
 </h2> 
 <h3>
    Sympotoms:
  </h3>
            <p>
               <p>
    The most common symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD) are chest pain (angina) and breathlessness.

But some people may not have any symptoms before they're diagnosed.
  </p> 
    <h4>
    Anagina:
  </h4>          
              <p>
               If your coronary arteries become partially blocked, it can cause chest pain<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/" target="_blank">(angina) </a>. This can be a mild, uncomfortable feeling similar to <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/indigestion/"  target="_blank"> indigestion.</a>

However, a severe angina attack can cause a painful feeling of heaviness or tightness, usually in the centre of the chest, which may spread to the arms, neck, jaw, back or stomach. 
            </p>
              <h4>
    Heart attacks:
  </h4>
  <p>
    If your arteries become completely blocked, it can cause a<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/" target="_blank"> heart attack</a> (myocardial infarction).
    During a heart attack, you may also have the following symptoms:
    <ul>
  <li>pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is travelling from your chest to your arms, jaw, neck, back or stomach</li>
  <li>lightheadedness</li>
  <li>  sweating</li>
  <li> nausea </li>
  <li> breathlessness</li>
    </p>   
     <p>
      The<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/symptoms/" target="_blank"> symptoms of a heart attack</a> can also be similar to indigestion.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Causes:
  </h3>
  <P>
    Coronary heart disease (CHD) is usually caused by a build-up of fatty deposits (atheroma) on the walls of the arteries around the heart (coronary arteries).
  </P>
  <P>
 The build-up of atheroma makes the arteries narrower, restricting the flow of blood to the heart muscle. This process is called <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/atherosclerosis/" target="_blank"> atherosclerosis.</a>
  </P>  
   <P>
    Your risk of developing atherosclerosis is significantly increased if you:
  </P>
  <ul>
    <li>smoke</li>
    <li>have high blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
    <li>have high cholesterol</li>
    <li>have high levels of lipoprotein (a)</li>
    <li>do not exercise regularly</li>
    <li>have diabetes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Other risk factors for developing atherosclerosis include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>being obese or overweight</li>
   <li>having a family history of CHD – the risk is increased if you have a male relative under the age of 55, or a female relative under 65, with CHD</li> 
    
  </ul>
  <h2>
    What are the ways to avoid or prevent?
  </h2>
  <p>
    There are several ways you can reduce your risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD), such as lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Eat a healthy, balanced diet 
  </h4>
  <p>
    A low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, which should include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (5 portions a day) and whole grains.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
      You should limit the amount of salt you eat to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day as too much salt will increase your blood pressure. 6g of salt is about 1 teaspoonful.
   </li> 
    <li>
     There are 2 types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. You should avoid food containing saturated fats, because these will increase the levels of bad cholesterol in your blood. 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
    Be more physically active
  </h4>
  <p>
   <ul>
     <li>
        Combining a healthy diet with regular exercise is the best way of maintaining a healthy weight. Having a healthy weight reduces your chances of developing high blood pressure.
     </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Regular exercise will make your heart and blood circulatory system more efficient, lower your cholesterol level, and also keep your blood pressure at a healthy level.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any aerobic exercise, such as walking, swimming and dancing, makes your heart work harder and keeps it healthy.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>
    What are the treatment methods?
  </h2>
 <img src="rh1.jpg" alt="HEART_INFO.png" width="300px"/>          
  <p>
    Treatment for coronary heart disease (CHD) can help manage the symptoms and reduce the risk of further problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Heart disease treatment depends on the cause and type of heart damage. Healthy lifestyle habits — such as eating a low-fat, low-salt diet, getting regular exercise and good sleep, and not smoking — are an important part of treatment.

  </p>
  <h4>
    Surgery or other procedures
  </h4>
 <p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       Some people with heart disease may need a procedure or surgery. The type of procedure or surgery will depend on the type of heart disease and the amount of damage to the heart.
     </li>
   </ul>
