            <h2>Parkinson's Disease</h2>
            <p>
                Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement.
                It occurs when there is a loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.
                Dopamine is a neurotransmitter responsible for transmitting signals that control and coordinate body movements.
                The reduction in dopamine leads to symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, slowness of movement, and difficulties with balance and coordination.
                While the exact cause is not fully understood, a combination of genetic and environmental factors is believed to contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease.
                It is a chronic and progressive condition, and management often involves medications, therapy, and lifestyle adjustments to improve quality of life for individuals affected by the disease.

            <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Involuntary shaking or trembling, usually in the hands, fingers, or other parts of the body.</li>
                <li>Slowness of movement, making simple tasks take longer to complete.</li>
                <li>Stiffness or resistance in the muscles, which can affect flexibility and range of motion.</li>
                <li>Difficulty maintaining balance and coordination, leading to an increased risk of falls.</li>
                <li>Difficulty in coordinating movements, resulting in a shuffling walk or problems with fine motor skills.</li>
                <li>Brief episodes where a person may feel temporarily unable to move, especially when initiating walking.</li>
                <li>Reduced facial expressions, often described as a "mask-like" appearance.</li>
                <li>Changes in speech patterns, including a softer voice or a lack of inflection.</li>
                <li>Reduced handwriting size and difficulty in fine motor control while writing.</li>
                <li>A decrease in the ability to detect or identify odors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>   Treatment:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>   Levodopa (L-DOPA): Converts to dopamine in the brain, helping to alleviate motor symptoms.</li>
                <li>   Dopamine Agonists: Mimic the effects of dopamine in the brain.</li>
                <li>   MAO-B Inhibitors and COMT Inhibitors: Extend the effects of levodopa by preventing its breakdown.</li>
                <li>   Anticholinergics: Help control tremors and muscle stiffness.</li>
